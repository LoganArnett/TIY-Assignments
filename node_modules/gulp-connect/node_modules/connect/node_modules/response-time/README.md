Response time header for node.js

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install response-time
```

## API

```js
var responseTime = require('response-time')
```

### responseTime(options)

Returns middleware that adds a `X-Response-Time` header to responses.

#### Options

`responseTime` accepts these properties in the options object.

##### digits

The fixed number of digits to include in the output, which is always in
milliseconds, defaults to `3` (ex: `2.300ms`).

##### header

The name of the header to set, defaults to `X-Response-Time`.

##### suffix

Boolean to indicate if units of measurement suffix should be added to
the output, defaults to `true` (ex: `2.300ms` vs `2.300`).

## Examples

### express/connect

```js
var express = require('express')
var responseTime = require('response-time')

var app = express()

app.use(responseTime())

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('hello, world!')
})
```

### vanilla http server

```js
var finalhandler = require('finalhandler')
var http = require('http')
var responseTime = require('response-time')

// create "middleware"
var _responseTime = responseTime()

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  var done = finalhandler(req, res)
  _responseTime(req, res, function (err) {
    if (err) return done(err)

    // respond to request
    res.setHeader('content-type', 'text/plain')
    res.end('hello, world!')
  })
})
```

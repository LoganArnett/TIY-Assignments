    <h1><center>There's Always MONEY IN THE BANANA STAND!!!</center></h1>

    <p>YOU'RE the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw! <br>
      A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. I may have<br>
      committed some light treason. Did Ted make an appointment? No. Well <br>
      \then Ted can GET THE HELL OUT OF THIS OFFICE! YOU GET THE HELL OUT! <br>
      First I blow him, then I poke him. So maybe you could start jete-ing,<br>
      and stop je-terrorizing me! They frame my junk. Heart attack never stopped<br>
      old big bear!</p><br>

    <p>It's OUR nausea. No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. It wasn't <br>
      really the pronunciation that bothered me.</p><br>

    <p>This was a big get for God. I may have committed some light treason.</p><br>

    <p>I was set up. By the Brits. A group of British builders operating <br>
      outside the O.C. It's so watery. And yet there's a smack of ham to <br>
      it. Mission Accomplished. We have unlimited juice? This party is going <br>
      to be off the hook. It ain't easy being white... No, Pop-pop does <br>
      not get a treat, I just brought you a [bleep]ing pizza. Even though so <br>
      many people in this office are begging for it.</p><br>

    <p>"Circumvent." It means "to go around." Gob : The old "reach around." <br>
      Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit? What about <br>
      macaroni-let me finish-salad? Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Are you <br>
      telling me you have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities? See for <br>
      more good stuff.</p>

/**
 * Check Writing
 *
 * Given an integer representing money -- $1234.56 -- convert
 * that into it;s string representation in English words. For
 * example, 1234.56 is "one thousand, two hundred thirty four
 * and 56/100s", just like you would see on a check.
 *
 * In a lot of ways this is the inverse of the "String Calculator"
 * problem, so a lot of what you've learned there will be put into
 * practice here, but backwards. Hooray!
 */

 /**
 * Sample Data
 *
 * $1234.56 => "one thousand, two hundred thirty four and 56/100s"
 * $123.45 => "one hundred twenty three and 45/100s"
 * $12.34 => "twelve and 34/100s"
 * $1.23 => "one and 23/100s"
 *
 * EXTRA Credit:
 * $12345678.90 => "twelve million, three hundred forty five thousand,
 * six hundred seventy eight and 90/100s"
 *
 * Make up your own, too.

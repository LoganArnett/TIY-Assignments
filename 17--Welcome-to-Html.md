A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. I may have
committed some light treason. Did Ted make an appointment? No.
Well then Ted can GET THE HELL OUT OF THIS OFFICE! YOU GET THE HELL OUT!
First I blow him, then I poke him. So maybe you could start jete-ing,
and stop je-terrorizing me! They frame my junk. Heart attack never s

 in this office are begging for it.
